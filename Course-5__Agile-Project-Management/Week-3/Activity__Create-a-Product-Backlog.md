# Activity: Create a Product Backlog     

### 01. 
## Activity Overview 

In this activity, you will write user stories and create acceptance criteria for each story based on customer needs. These user stories, collected under one epic, will form
the basis of a Product Backlog.

**Note:** Throughout this course, you will complete tasks normally done by others (like the Development Team or Product Owner). Even if you don't perform them
yourself it is important that you understand these processes. 

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able
to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.


## Scenario
Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step-instructions.

Imagine you are overseeing the development and launch of Virtual Verde, Office Green's new product line. Virtual Verde's mission is to make working from home more enjoyable by offering desk plants for home office use. New customers recently received the first batch of plants.

As a next step, your team had planned to introduce new product offerings to the Virtual Verde catalog—starting with Bonsai trees. However, a customer survey discovered that 70% of the new customers had difficulty caring for their plants. Many of the plants wilted and died within a month. This information inspired the team
to develop new offerings and companion products to help new owners care for their plants. 

From the survey, Office Green leamed that they can create value for their customers by making it easy to:
- Find out which plants are easiest to care for    
- Access care instructions easily   
- Have the right tools to care for their plants   
- Remember when to water their plants   
- Getexpert help and advice quickly   
- Have a hassle-free way to return their orders   

You will work with your team to create user stories that will help them build solutions to address these customer needs, and add them to the Product Backlog. Your team has already added Bonsai tree user stories to the Backlog, but the new plant care stories have now become the top priority.

**Note:** In general, the Product Owner leads in prioritizing the Backlog and addressing new concerns. Anyone can work on user stories, but the Development Team
typically gives feedback on them.


## Step-by-Step Instructions 

### Step 1: Access the template 
To use the template for this course item, click the link below and select “Use Template.” 
Link to template: [Product Backlog](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VZkQm_4Oc_RO98dYnoWJdhPjANK2W7B1sNIEW5sUUsQ/template/preview?resourcekey=0-5E1DB0W_ZJmdE17__6mMCA)  


### Step 2: Create six user stories
Using the Bonsai tree stories in the Backlog template as a model, create six new user stories—one to address each of the six customer needs from the scenario. Your user stories should follow this construction:

**As a `<user role>`, I want <this action> so that I can `<get this value>`.**

For the **`<user role>`** part of each story, consider what sort of person might have that specific customer need. They might be a potential customer, a new plant owner, or something else. Keep in mind that these stories should help customers who may not have much experience caring for plants.

For the **<action>** part of each user story, fill in the specific customer need.

For the **`<value>`** part of each story, think about why your user might want to perform that particular action and _how_ it will help them.
When completed, each story should express a customer need the team can work to fulfill. For example, imagine that a customer wants to learn about different styles of
Bonsai cutting and shaping. A related user story might read: 

“As a new Bonsai tree owner, I want to learn about different Bonsai styles so that I can pick the right one for my tree.”


### Step 3: Create acceptance criteria
Create at least two acceptance criteria for each story, and add them to the template. Remember that acceptance criteria help your team establish a Definition of Done.
They represent the things your team needs to accomplish before they can consider the user story complete.

For example, the acceptance criteria for the Bonsai styles user story could include:
  1. _"Customers can access a guide to different styles (formal & informal upright, broom, cascade, etc.) on website"_ 
  2. _"Customers can take a quiz to match their trees to suitable styles”_


### Step 4: Check your stories against the I.N.V.E.S.T. criteria
Next, consult the I.N.V.E.S.T. framework to make sure your user stories are concise, specific, and actionable. 
- **Independent:** The story's completion is not dependent on another story. 
- **Negotiable:** There is room for negotiation and discussion about how to complete the story. 
- **Valuable:** Completing the user story will deliver value for the user role. 
- **Estimable:** The Definition of Done must be clear so that the team can give the story an estimate. 
- **Small:** Each user story and the work necessary to complete it should fit within a planned Sprint.  
- **Testable:** A test can be conducted to make sure the story meets the acceptance criteria (even if the test is not yet planned). 
You may not be able to account for all the I.N.V.E.S.T. criteria in this exercise, but you should try to meet as many as you can. If a story meets three or fewer criteria, consider revising it.  


### Step 5: Title each user story 
Create a title for each story and add it to the template. The titles should briefly describe the desired outcome for the user role, so the team can reference them quickly. 


### Step 6: Add an epic title 
Create an epic title that can serve as a heading or a theme for all six stories—for example, “Plant Care Initiatives"—and add it to the Backlog template. 

_**Note:** Keep in mind that a real Product Backlog would encompass all aspects of the project, including many different epics. For your reference, we have created a second epic as an example._
